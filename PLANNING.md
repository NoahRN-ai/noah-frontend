# PLANNING.md

## Project Overview
Noah Frontend is a modern web UI/UX project built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. The goal is to provide a modular, maintainable, and scalable frontend for the Noah platform.

## Tech Stack
- React (functional components, hooks)
- Vite (build tool)
- Tailwind CSS (utility-first styling)
- JavaScript (optionally TypeScript in future)
- Jest (for testing)

## Architectural Principles
- Modular, feature-based folder structure
- Reusable, composable components
- Centralized context and state management
- Clear separation of concerns (components, pages, utils, context)
- Strict adherence to style and linting rules

## Constraints
- No inclusion of vinnyjobtrackertool or related code
- Keep files under 500 lines; refactor as needed
- All new logic must be unit tested

## Next Steps
- Complete initial restructure (see TASK.md)
- Update README and documentation
- Review and refactor large files
